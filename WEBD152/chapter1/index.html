    <p>All teas are made from the same plant. Whether it is green tea, black tea, or anything, it is all made from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant, the differnece being how it is processed after. Green tea is un-oxcidized while black tea is fully oxidized. My favorite tea is Oolong tea, which is in the middle, typeically 20 to 60 percent oxidized. In Japan, oolong tea is popular due to its refreshing yet light taste. It is said to stimulate increased calorie burning by boosting your metabolism for a couple of hours after drinking it. In part due to this and its refreshing taste, many restaurants in Japan that serve heavy or oily food serve this type of tea as a way for you to rest your stomach after eating. If you ever have a very full stomach and would like to ease it, I definitely recommend trying Oolong tea .</p>
