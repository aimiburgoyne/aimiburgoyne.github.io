    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in North Carolina into a military family with a Japanese
      mother. I moved a lot growing up, living in North Carolina, New York,
      Hawaii, Japan, and San Diego. My father retired when I was in middle
      school in San Diego, so I lived there the longest (6 years total). After
      graduating from high school in San Diego, I moved to Japan for college.
    </p>

      After graduating from college, I worked as an English teacher at a
      preschool for one year and then changed to my current job. I work in a
      recruiting firm as something called a "Senior Candidate Advisor". I have
      multiple consultants in my team who each work with their own clients and
      get the jobs, and then I work directly with people looking for jobs and
      introduce them to the roles my team works on.

      For the past few years, I have been taking online courses at Mesa to
      continue learning new skills. I have always been interested in computer
      science and in college had my first experience with programming. It was a
      simple course that covered very basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However,
      that was around 6 years ago so I recently decided to change my major to
      web design and begin studying again. I took the beginning HTML and CSS
      course last semester and the content was mostly a (highly needed)
      refresher from what I learned in college. Through this class, I am hoping
      to expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS and learn new concepts.
